**Expalin best practices:**

    A good practice is to keep dynamic (changing) parts of a website in seperate files. Then include them in the main file. It makes it easier to make changes to a website if content is in a seperate file.

    Splitting a main file into chunks is a good use case for inclusion. For example, a component that is common among many pages is a good use case for inclusion as well.
    A navigation bar that is persisent across a website / webapp is a great example.
**Explain drawbacks**:

    However, splitting those chunks into more chunks is not advised. It would get redundant and slowing rendering down due to loading more files than necessary.

    The include directive is limited to including files on the host server. It cannot include files from a different website or FTP server.
